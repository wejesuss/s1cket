## :information_source: About

An API to search for investment funds, prices, and volume of your preferred stock, anything you want.

## :interrobang: Reason

The first goal for this project was to learn more about typescript, which I have used just one time, the second is because I love the investment world and I accidentally discovered the Alpha Vantage API.


## :seedling: Minimum Requirements

- NodeJS v10
- YARN
- You also need an API_KEY from Alpha Vantage, you can get this [free](https://www.alphavantage.co/)

## :rocket: Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technologies

- NodeJS
- Typescript
- Express
- Axios
- Celebrate

## :school_satchel: How to Use
First you need an API_KEY to use the Alpha Vantage's API that this repository rely, you can get your api_key [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/)

After this, do that (I suppose you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed)

1. Clone this repository
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/wejesuss/s1cket && cd s1cket
    # You can also download the zip in your repository page
    ```

2. Configure the API_KEY
    1. You need to set your API_KEY on your system environment variables as `ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY`. You can google this.

3. Install Dependecies and Run
    ```bash
    $ yarn install
    # start the API
    $ yarn run dev
    ```
Your server should be running on `http://localhost:3333/`

4. Routes
There is five routes provided by this API:
    1. `/` - Here you can obtain up to five informations about stocks, funds investments and others. See how it works:

        Params:
        - search: A string that can ocupe more than one values if you separate them by comma (`,`)

            type: `string`;

            max-length: 1026;

            return-type: An array of `objects` with global informations about that stock/funds you passed the symbol

        ```typescript
            [{
                'symbol': string,
                'open': string,
                'high': string,
                'low': string,
                'price': string,
                'volume': string,
                'latestTradingDay': string,
                'previousClose': string,
                'change': string,
                'changePercent': string
            }]
        ```

        Examples: `http://localhost:3333/?search=IBM`;
        `http://localhost:3333/?search=IBM,PYPL`;


    2. `/search` - Forgot the symbol? don't worry, you can search by this. See how it works:

        Params:

        - name: The name of the company or investment fund you want to find

            type: `string`;

            return-type: An array of `objects` with companies/funds with a symbol/name similar to the one you searched for

            ```typescript
            [{
                'symbol': string,
                'name': string,
                'type': string,
                'region': string,
                'marketOpen': string,
                'marketClose': string,
                'timezone': string,
                'currency': string,
                'matchScore': string
            }]
            ```

        Examples: `http://localhost:3333/search/microsoft`; `http://localhost:3333/search/paypal`

    3. `/currencies/exchange` - Get the exchange rate between two currencies. See how it works:

        Params:

        - from_currency: The currency you would like to get the exchange rate for

            type: `string`;

            options: `any` value located in the [`currencies.json`](src/validators/currencies.json) file. Choose the one you prefer :smile:;

        - to_currency: The destination currency for the exchange rate

            type: `string`;

            options: `any` value located in the [`currencies.json`](src/validators/currencies.json) file. Choose the one you prefer :smile:;

        return-type: An `object` with `currencyExchangeRate` key with the information of the two currencies and bid/ask price values

        ```typescript
        {
            currencyExchangeRate: {
                fromCurrencyCode: string;
                fromCurrencyName: string;
                toCurrencyCode: string;
                toCurrencyName: string;
                exchangeRate: string;
                lastRefreshed: string;
                timeZone: string;
                bidPrice: string;
                askPrice: string;
            };
        }
        ```

        Examples:
            `http://localhost:3333/currencies/exchange?from_currency=btc&to_currency=usd`;
            `http://localhost:3333/currencies/exchange?from_currency=brl&to_currency=USD`;
            `http://localhost:3333/currencies/exchange?from_currency=USD&to_currency=brl`;

        return-type: An `object` with `data` and `timeSeries` keys with timestamp (ISO format) and open/high/low/close/volume values

        ```typescript
        {

    8. `/prices/daily` - Find the prices of one specific stock/funds using daily prices. See how it works:

        Params: Same as `/prices/intraday` but `/prices/daily` does not contain `interval` parameter

        return-type: Same as `prices/intraday` but without `interval` key

        ```typescript

                'timeZone': string
            },
            'timeSeries': //This does not change
        }
        ```

        Examples:
        `http://localhost:3333/prices/intraday/ibm`;
        `http://localhost:3333/prices/intraday/msft`;
        `http://localhost:3333/prices/intraday/ibm?outputsize=full`;

    9. `/prices/weekly` - Find the prices of one specific stock/funds using weekly prices. See how it works:

        Params: Same as `/prices/daily` but `/prices/weekly` does not contain `outputsize` parameter

        return-type: Same as `prices/daily` but without `outputSize` key

        ```typescript
        {
            'data': {
                'information': string,
                'symbol': string,
                'lastRefreshed': string,
                'timeZone': string
            },
            'timeSeries': //This does not change

        ```

        Examples:
        `http://localhost:3333/prices/intraday/ibm`;
        `http://localhost:3333/prices/intraday/msft`;

    obs: Some stocks/funds does not support timeseries (intraday, daily, weekly). In that case your reponse will be something like this

    ```typescript
    {
        "error":"Invalid API call. Please retry or visit the documentation (https://www.alphavantage.co/query/documentation/) for TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY."
    }
    ```

    The same thing occurs with `currencies/prices` and `currencies/exchange` (_eg. Fetch the following will give an error_):
    `http://localhost:3333/currencies/prices/daily/RPX`
    `http://localhost:3333/currencies/exchange?from_currency=usd&to_currency=btc`
